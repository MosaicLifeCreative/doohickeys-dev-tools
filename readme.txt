== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin folder to `/wp-content/plugins/`
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Navigate to **Dev Tools** in your admin sidebar
4. Start building!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin affect my site's frontend? =

No. Doohickey's Dev Tools only loads on its own admin page. It adds zero scripts, styles, or markup to your public-facing site.

= Do I need to be online for the tools to work? =

Most tools work entirely offline once the page is loaded. The QR Code generator and Placeholder Image generator use client-side rendering. No external API calls are made.

= What does the Pro version include? =

Pro unlocks 5 additional tools (Palette Generator, Code Formatter, Diff Checker, HTML Table Generator, Test Data Generator) plus advanced features in 5 more tools. The Pro version is available separately at mosaiclifecreative.com.

= Is my code/data sent anywhere? =

Never. All processing happens in your browser. Nothing is transmitted to external servers.
